//Create an array of movies with at least three movies.
let movies = ["Avatar", "John Wick", "Mission Impossible"];
//Using the array from above, store the first movie in a variable
firstMovie = movies[0];
console.log(firstMovie);
//Get the length of the original array and store it in a new variable
moviesLength = movies.length;
//Get the last element in that array and store it in a new variable. What if your array was really large and you didn't know the last index? Would your solution still work?
